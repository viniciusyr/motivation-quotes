Just to know: I started this project just thinking about make a simple css website, which it is, but I ended learning a little bit of ExpressJS and REST API.
It's a quite amazing how a simple idea drives yourself to learn more and more. However, I will keep learning the foundations and data struct. Theres a long run to go.
